*AgentDoc*

**Description**:  
AgentDoc is a multi-agent document analysis tool that leverages LangChain and advanced AI models (e.g., OpenAI API) to process and analyze large documents. The system uses a multi-agent architecture where each agent performs a specific task—such as text extraction, summarization, entity recognition, and keyword extraction—to provide comprehensive insights from documents.

This tool is designed to showcase the power of multi-agent collaboration and advanced language models in automating and enhancing document analysis. AgentDoc can be used for various purposes, such as patent research, legal document review, or general text analytics.

**Key Features**:
- Multi-Agent System (MAS) for distributed document analysis.
- Text extraction, summarization, named entity recognition, and keyword extraction using OpenAI and LangChain.
- Asynchronous task execution and coordination between agents.
- Full-text search powered by Elasticsearch.
- Dockerized for easy deployment and scalable across environments.
